# Data visualization with Python (yt and nonos): pre-requisites

These tutorials require Python 3.8 or newer.

Both tutorials include requirement files. It is strongly advised to create virtual
environments before installing anything specifically for these tutorials. To get
started, navigate to a tutorial's subdirectory

```shell
$ cd idefix-days/tutorials/viz/<dir>
```
(where `<dir>` is `yt` or `nonos`)

and create a virtual environment...

... with conda
```shell
$ conda create --name=<name> python=3.10
$ conda activate <name>
```
(`<name>` is a placeholder, for instance `nonos_tuto`, and the Python version is
indicative)

... or with `venv`
```shell
$ python -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then proceed to install requirements
```shell
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Cleaning the mess

Between sessions, and before we move on, you might want to clean up your shell and your
disk ! Here's how to.

#### Deactivate your virtual env

on conda
```shell
$ conda deactivate
```

or with `venv`
```shell
$ source deactivate
```

#### Remove the virtual env
with conda
```shell
$ conda remove --all --name <name>
```

or with `venv`
```shell
$ rm -fr .venv
```
